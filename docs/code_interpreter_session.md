# CodeInterpreterSession

The CodeInterpreterSession is the main class that manages a conversational session between the user and AI agent. It handles starting, stopping and checking status of the secure isolated code execution environment.

Key responsibilities:

- Starting and stopping the compute session
- Sending user input and files to the agent
- Running code in the compute container
- Retrieving output files and images
- Managing the chat history
- Logging

It provides methods like:

- `generate_response()`: Generate AI response for user input
- `start() / stop()`: Start and stop the session
- `log()`: Log messages
- `show_code` - Callback to print code before running.

The response generation happens through a pipeline:

1. User input is parsed
2. Code is executed if needed
3. Files are processed if needed
4. Final response is formatted and returned

The `generate_response()` method handles this entire pipeline.

Usage:

```python
from codeinterpreterapi import CodeInterpreterSession

with CodeInterpreterSession() as session:
  response = session.generate_response("Plot a histogram of the data")
print(response.content) # print AI response
```
