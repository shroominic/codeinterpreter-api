# Using the Streamlit Webapp

The streamlit webapp allows interacting with the API through a GUI:

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py --browser.gatherUsageStats=False
```

This will launch the webapp where you can:

- Write prompts and see results immediately
- Upload files that get passed to the API
- Download any files produced by the API
- Switch between different models like GPT-3.5 Turbo

So the webapp allows easily leveraging the API through a graphical interface.
