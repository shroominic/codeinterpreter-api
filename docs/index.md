# CodeInterpreterAPI Documentation

CodeInterpreterAPI is a Python-based API designed give LLM Agents access to python and execute code. It provides a session-based conversational chat interface and the agent framework with a tool for executing code in a secure and isolated environment.

## Key Classes

### CodeInterpreterSession

This is the main class that manages a code execution session. It provides methods to start, stop, and check the status of the session. It also handles logging and file uploads for the session.

#### Methods

* `from_id(session_id: UUID, **kwargs) -> "CodeInterpreterSession"`: This class method creates a new session from a given UUID.
* `start() -> SessionStatus`: This method starts the session.
* `stop() -> SessionStatus`: This method stops the session.
* `log(msg: str) -> None`: This method logs a message.

### CodeBox

This class represents the code execution environment. It provides methods to upload files, execute code, and check the status of the execution. For more information look into the codebox api documentation.

## Usage

To use this API, create a new `CodeInterpreterSession` and use the `start` method to start the session. You can then use the `generate_response_sync` method to generate an AI response and the `stop` method to stop the session. You can use the generate response method multiple times in a single session to have a conversation with the AI.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please make sure to write functional Python with full type hinting and only write needed and precise comments.
